    <p>Here's some drawings I made using some Sharpies and my iPad. These were mostly for an art class that I took at the University of Michigan. Each piecehad a new focus every week, so some pieces have interesting topics, like the pineapple drawings. I used my iPad to draw some of it and sharpies to draw other pieces. </p>
    <br>

    <div class="first-group">
        <img src="imgs/colorpineapple.png" alt="Colorful Pineapple">
        <img src="imgs/dice.png" alt="Dice">
        <img src="imgs/glasses.png" alt="Glasses">
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="first-words">
      <p> These three are drawings of objects in my surroundings. Each one was initially created with sharpie and then scanned on my iPad and improved on the Procreate app. I added in some color on the pineapple, inverted colors on the dice, and added different textures on the glass lens.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="second-group">
        <img src="imgs/face.png" alt="Face">
        <img src="imgs/pineapple.png" alt="Pineapple">
        <img src="imgs/mug.png" alt="Mug">
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="second-words">
      <p> These three are drawings of more objects in my surroundings but each has more creativity. They each flow out to the end of the paper with a pattern.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="third-group">
        <img src="imgs/name.png" alt="Name">
        <img src="imgs/hexagons.png" alt="Hexagons">
        <img src="imgs/swirls.png" alt="Swirls">
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="third-words">
      <p> These three are patterns I created from scratch. One features my nickname "Liv," and the other two are just different shapes turned into unique patterns. I had a lot of fun creating these.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
      
    <h2> Key Takeaways:</h2>
    <p> Each design either was drawn off the page or had a border to provide a certain effect. This class also helped me learn how to edit drawings with the Adobe Suite. I now know more graphic design concepts as a result of this class. I think this helps with Web Design.</p>
